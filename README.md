# Go-Microservices
This repo contains small backend projects that I make as I learn about microservice development in Go, utilizing tools such as gRPC and Docker.

### Available Services:
- [Arithmetic API with gRPC and protobuf](gRPC)
- [Chat App with Docker, gRPC, and protobuf](gRPC_Docker-ChatApp)
- [RPC Server and Client](RPC-Server)
